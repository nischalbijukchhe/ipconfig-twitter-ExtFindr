# ExtFindr

**ExtFindr** A simple Python based tool designed to scan URLs for high-severity file extensions. This script leverages `gau` to find URLs, then filters them to identify file types such as `.sql`, `.bak`, `.db`, `.config` and other potentially sensitive extensions.

## Usage

To use **ExtFindr**, follow these steps:

1. Create a text file containing the list of URLs you want to scan. Each URL should be on a new line.

    ```
    https://example.com
    https://targetsite.com
    https://vulnerablewebsite.com
    ```
2. Run the script with the `-l` flag to specify your URL list and optionally use the `-o` flag to save results to a file:
    ```bash
    python extfindr.py -l urls.txt -o results.txt
    ```
    - **`-l`**: Specify the input file with URLs.
    - **`-o`**: (Optional) Output file to save the results.

### Example

```bash
python extfindr.py -l urls.txt -o found_results.txt
```

```bash
python extfindr.py -h

Usage: python extfindr.py -l <url_list_file> [-o <output_file>] [-t <num_threads>]

Options:
-l, --list          File containing list of URLs to scan (required)
-o, --output        Output file to save the results (optional)
