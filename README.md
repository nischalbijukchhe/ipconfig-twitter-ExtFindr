# ExtFindr
A simple Python based tool designed to scan URLs for high-severity file extensions. This script leverages `gau` to find URLs, then filters them to identify file types such as `.sql`, `.bak`, `.db`, `.config`, other potentially sensitive extensions. The results are displayed in the terminal with color-coded output for easier interpretation.
